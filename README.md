# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
In this project, I assisted Robin in performing a data analysis on news and facts related to Mars. Since her company, "SpaceForward", is interested in extracting resources from nearby planets, she wants to be fully prepared for any potential missions. 

## Summary
1. I used Web-Scraping to gather news articles on Mars, which included both the titles and content. This should help inform Robin on any current missions associated with Mars and provide insight for her company.

2. I also scraped a table, which contained temperature data for Mars. After analyzing the data, I discovered the following results:

- The coldest months on Mars are March and April
- The warmest months on Mars are August and September
- May and June have the Lowest atmospheric pressure
- September and October have the highest atmospheric pressure

## Results
Based on my analysis, September would be the best month to launch Missions to Mars. The weather conditions are favorable and it should be perfect for extracting potential resources.
